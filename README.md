# ``minerals_supply_scenario``

## Using market forecasts to develop asset-level mineral supply scenarios

Python library designed to assist in the development of asset-level scenarios for minerals supply. The tool streamlines the process of importing, processing, and analyzing mining asset data from the S&P Capital IQ Pro database. It allows modelling various supply scenarios for different commodities.

Features
----------------------------

- **Data import from S&P databases**: Import raw datasets from S&P Capital IQ Pro database and clean, transform, and fill data gaps.
- **Scenario development**: Create and analyze multiple mineral supply scenarios using attributes of the imported dataset. By default, creates scenarios based on the development stage of the mining projects.
- **Export for use in prospective life cycle assessment**: Provides functionalities to export the resulting scenario data in a format that can be used directly with the [premise tool](https://github.com/polca/premise) for creating prospective life cycle inventory databases.
